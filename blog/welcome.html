                <h3>Welcome</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Hi!</p>

                <p>I’m Nicole, a brand new yoga teacher. I recently finished up my training at Garden State Yoga-Glen Rock, under the guidance of some fantastic mentors. I’ve been lucky enough to take on great classes at some of my favorite studios, and
                    couldn’t be more excited to share my schedule with you. Click on the schedule tab at the top of this page to see where I’ll be!</p>

                <p> I graduated from The College of New Jersey in 2010, where I earned a B.S. in Health and Exercise Science. It was during these years that I grew fascinated with movement and the human body. I also got my first taste of real-life stress.
                    Enter Yoga. My first class was in 2006 at the Princeton Center for Yoga and Health, where I hit the (rented) mat to relax after tough workouts, tougher exams and various personal crises. While I expected a good stretch and maybe a
                    nap, I wasn’t prepared for what came next. I found a deep sense of relaxation in connecting movement to breath, of course, but these classes ignited a curiosity that has followed me ever since…</p>

                <p>Upon my return to Northern New Jersey, I met my most influential teacher, Jody Domerstad, who introduced me to a method of Yoga that emphasized alignment. To me this means aligning the body, the mind, and the spirit. My favorite definition
                    for the practice is: “Yoga is the state of needing nothing” and I got my first taste of that with her. I was hooked, and committed to learning as much about Yoga as I possibly could.</p>

                <p>It has been several years since that first meeting, and I am so proud to say that I learned to be a teacher from a master teacher who has also become a cherished friend. I’ve found that in the time since, yoga has always been there for
                    me, and has helped me see everything more clearly–I’ve been lifted through the tough times and found more joy in the good times. These days, I practice many styles of yoga and have been influenced by several incredible teachers, and
                    that mix shows in my classes. I like to say I teach a funky flow set to music (another huge part of my life) while still paying close attention to alignment. I like to do it all!</p>

                <p>My professional background is in rehabilitation, and I believe in the healing power of yoga as a means of all sorts of recovery. I’ll be a lifelong learner, and I’ve taken extensive coursework in the exercise sciences (human anatomy, kinesiology,
                    biomechanics) and nutrition since college. I also plan to attend massage and bodywork school in the fall. I’m fascinated by anything health and wellness related, and am excited to share my musings on all things holistic on this very
                    blog!
                </p>

                <p>When I’m not in down dog, I can be found farmer’s market trolling, cooking up a storm, writing, playing various musical instruments (poorly), and hanging with my cockapoo, Eli.</p>

                <p>Thanks so much for stopping by! See you on the mat!</p>

                <p>In Peace,</p>

                <p>Nicole</p>
